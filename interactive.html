  <h1>Meander</h1>

  <p><a href="http://inconvergent.net/meander/">Meander</a> is an interative
  WebGL experiment. It started out as an attempt to create meandering river
  structures that would move across the screen. Somehow it ended up being a
  series of particles randomly moving around on the canvas.  The experiment is
  also listed on <a
    href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/meander">Chrome
    Experiments</a>!</p>

  <h1>Waves</h1>

  <p><a href="http://inconvergent.net/waves/">Waves</a> is an interative
  (desktop only) WebGL wave simulation built using Three.js. You can interact
  with the surface using the mouse. This experiment was mostly an excercise for
  me in doing some physics calculations on the GPU.</p>

  <h1>Isopleth</h1>

  <p><a href="http://inconvergent.net/isopleth/">Isopleth</a> is a WebGL
  experiment that generates random landscapes using the "midpoint rule". The
  application should work on most newer devices.</p>

  <h1>Landscape</h1>

  <p>The problem with the method used for generating landscapes on <a
    href="http://inconvergent.net/isopleth/">Isopleth</a> is that it is done in
  a regular grid. Because of this it has a tendency to give some undesired
  effects that make it look unnatural. <a
    href="http://inconvergent.net/landscape/">Landscape</a> attempts to
  alleviate this problem by using an unstructured grid instead.</p>

  <p>When I was working on the algorithm I was randomly trying different
  methods of giving the surface a texture. Since I was working on a landscape I
  figured I'd try to add contour lines. The results have more Moir√© than
  contour lines, but I like the absurdity of it. The effect is a little hard to
  capture on pictures, so you should definitely <a
    href="http://inconvergent.net/landscape/">have a look</a> for yourself.</p>

  <h1>City</h1>

  <p><a href="http://inconvergent.net/city/">City</a> is a generative WebGL
  experiment based on the Delaunay triangulation and some shader trickery.</p>
