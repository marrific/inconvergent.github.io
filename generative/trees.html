<h2>Trees</h2>

<p>When we are on the subject of branches I figured I could mention this
similar little thing I wrote.</p>

<p>I wanted to try to grow branches in a similar way to Hyphae, but have new
branches only appear on the "tip" of other branches. In addition I don't worry
about collisions or anything like that in this simulation. The results are not
quite trees, but they can be rather convincing if you don't look very
carefully.</p>

<p>The perhaps most interesting thing to note here is that no tree ever grew
from the trunk up at fixed width, like these so-called trees do. Trees grow
both in height and width over time, and it is a very dynamic process with loads
of factors. Hence this algorithm has very little in common with actual trees,
but the few naive rules of this algorithm still make a decent job of mimicking
real life trees.</p>

<p>To add some depth to the trees I add some shadow on the branches as they
grow. By adding a little more shadow on one side you get a nice depth
illusion.</p>
