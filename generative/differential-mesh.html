<h2>Differential Mesh</h2>

<p>When I had gotten Differential Line working the obvious next step was to try
to create something similar in three dimensions.  On obvious alternative is to
make the line move in three dimensions, but that did not really seem all that
appealing. Instead I chose to go for a combination of the attraction/rejection
behaviour of Differential Line, and the growing behaviour of Hyphae.
Essentially I wanted to make a (triangular) mesh that grew outward without
self-intersecting or colliding. Doing this directly in three dimensions seemed
a little daunting, so I started with a two dimensional version.</p>

<p>Now we scale down the triangle size and add some structure.</p>

<p>The hope was that this set of rules would resemble the growth of slime mold
or, more likely, lichen. It turns out the basic version of this is quite
similar to certain types of lichens. And it seems to match the growth of <a

as was pointed out to me on <a
  href="https://twitter.com/CieraReports/status/621068347430449152">twitter</a>.</p>

<p>The way I initially controlled the growth was to choose random edges, check
if they were on the outside if the structure, and see if I could attach a new
triangle to that edge. The problem with this strategy is that eventually most
edges are going to be on the "inside" if the structure. This means that you are
going to spend a lot of resources checking edges that you can't do anything
with.</p>

<p>There is a pretty obvious solution to this problem. (And, as usual, when I
say obvious I mean that it took me a few months to realize) Instead of picking
random edges and testing if you can grow a new triangle from it, you can use
food sources. First you randomly position food sources in the domain.  Then you
have something happen each time an edge in the structure hits one of these food
sources. For instance if you let the growth of the mesh spike when a food
source is hit you get something like this.</p>

<p>If you let this simulation run for a while you can get a number of
interesting results. Here is a version where the color of each triangle
gradually changes according to when it was created. The color changes gradually
from white to black, then flips instantly back to white again. The first time I
did this it was an accident, but as you can see it gives it a nice three
dimensional illusion.</p>
